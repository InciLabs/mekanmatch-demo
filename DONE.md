# DONE

This document tracks completed tasks for the MekanMatch Expo app migration and improvements.

## Completed

### UI Components & Theming
- Folderized all UI components under `app/components/ui/` with `index.tsx` entries and colocated stories
- Standardized Storybook stories to a simple RN pattern (decorator + padded container)
- Migrated replit-ui components to Expo-native counterparts (Breadcrumb, Pagination, AspectRatio, AlertDialog, Menubar, ContextMenu, HoverCard, Drawer, Sidebar, ToggleGroup, InputOTP, Calendar, Command, ScrollArea, Resizable, Carousel, SimpleBarChart, Progress, Slider, Collapsible)
- Implemented `app/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` with neutral palette (white, gray100-400, etc.)
- Fixed `Input` disabled prop and typing, `InputOTP` ref callback, and various router typing casts

### Notification System
- Implemented full notification system with `expo-notifications` and `expo-device`
- Created type-safe `NotificationContext` with:
  - Badge count management
  - Local and scheduled notifications
  - Proper error handling and type safety
  - Cross-platform support (Android/iOS)
- Added notification service with methods for:
  - Push notification registration
  - Token management
  - Local notifications
  - Badge management
  - Notification clearing

### TypeScript & Tooling
- Resolved all TypeScript errors in the app
- Updated `tsconfig.json` to properly scope type checking
- Added proper type definitions for all components and services
- Ensured type safety across the entire codebase

### Documentation
- Updated README with UI system, Storybook, and TypeScript type-check instructions
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments for all notification-related code
- Documented component props and context usage

## Notes

- Legacy web code under `replit-generated/` and `app/replit_ui/` is intentionally excluded from app type-check and unused in RN app.
- Notification system is fully implemented with proper error handling and type safety.
