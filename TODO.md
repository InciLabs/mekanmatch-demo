# TODO

This document tracks pending tasks for the MekanMatch Expo app.

## High Priority

- [ ] Validate all folderized UI components
  - Verify imports from `app/components/ui/index.ts`
  - Ensure stories still run and cover main states

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Sidebar stories: add icons and nested items
- [ ] Form stories: async submit + error summary examples
- [ ] README: RN chart library guidance

## Low Priority

- [ ] Calendar: add date range selection UX polish
- [ ] Additional chart demos (lines, pie) if needed

## Notes

- Legacy web scaffolding under `replit-generated/` and old UI under `app/replit_ui/` are excluded from app type-check and not used by the RN app.
- Notification system has been fully implemented with type safety and proper error handling.
